                            This project was built at a Yelp hackathon in just over 24 hours. Torch is a series of daemons that exist to communicate to browser sessions remotely through IRC. his project was built was to provide an easy interface (via an IRC bot) to change content displayed remotely on large monitors around Yelp's engineering office. It consists of two components: wick, and lighter. A lighter instance communicates to many Mac Minis, each of which runs a wick instance. A wick instance controls Chrome session and takes requests made by a lighter instance and executes (Applescript) commands accordingly. Both wick and lighter daemons are written in Python using Flask.py, a minimal web framework.

Each light has a range of 4096 colors (each of the Red, Green, and Blue, color channels capable of 16 values). The front-end was built in Raphael.js, an SVG image library for Javascript, and talked to the backend (a Node.js server that communicates with a hardware controller daemon via Zero.mq) via Socket.IO.

This <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbeuxyuF3E0">video</a> shows the project using various programs we'd written for it. The project won first place at Yahoo's UIUC hackathon for the year 2011, which qualifies our team for Yahoo's National hackathon in 2012.
